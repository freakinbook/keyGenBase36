A little project I did for a freelance client. 

The task was to make a program that generates a 16-digit key that consists of [A-Z],[0-9]. So base36 digits. 

User should be able to "freeze" some of the digits so that other digits change in the next generation and "frozen" digits stay the same. Keys are generated in the UI by one or are output to the .txt file continuously until stopped.
